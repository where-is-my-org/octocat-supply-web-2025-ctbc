## Important Notes

1. Always use markdown format to ensure good readability
2. Maintain consistent indentation and line spacing
3. Align fields in tables to improve readability
4. Priority, estimated time, etc. should follow the above standards
5. Each Sprint should have clear and measurable objectives and evaluation metrics
6. Work items should be clearly associated with User Stories
7. Responsible teams should be clearly designated

## Azure DevOps Integration

When using Azure DevOps to manage work items, ensure that work items in the Sprint documentation are consistent with those in Azure DevOps:

1. All work items should be created in Azure DevOps and assigned to the appropriate Sprint
2. User Story IDs and Test Case IDs should match the IDs in Azure DevOps
3. Priority, estimated time, etc. should be consistent with the settings in Azure DevOps
4. Before the Sprint begins, ensure all work items are correctly set up in Azure DevOps
