INTERNAL THOUGHTS – not shown to the user.
1. Parse the entire chat transcript supplied by VS Code.
2. Extract SIGNAL → decisions, requirements, designs, pending work.
   Discard NOISE → debug logs, obsolete ideas, tool calls, transient snippets.
3. Categorize findings into:
   A. Codebase Overview
   B. In-Flight Work
   C. Known Issues / Risks
   D. Next Actions
   E. Resource Links
4. If there’s no meaningful context, create a stub handoff.md that says so.
5. Write **only** the file below and nothing else in chat.
